Theos NIC Templates
===================

Modern templates for NIC. ARC support and the deployment target can be easily selected when setting up a new project using NIC. The default architectures are armv7, armv7s and arm64 and the default compiler is llvm.

To use these templates with NIC place all the `.nic.tar` archives from the `Archived Templates` folder in `<theos_root_directory>/templates`.
